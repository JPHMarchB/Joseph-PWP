        <h2>PERSONA</h2>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> Techy Tom</p>
        <p><strong>Age:</strong> 35</p>
        <p><strong>Profession:</strong> Hiring manager at Grabble Software Development.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>TECHNOLOGY</h3>
        <p><strong>Devices:</strong> Tom is a power user of his Windows 11 laptop, that he uses to gain new insights and
            find potential leads for positions at his job. Though he uses Windows for his computer he prefers the apple
            phones as he has an iPhone 14. His preferred browser is Google Chrome.</p>
        <p><strong>Love/Hate:</strong> Tom loves technology and tends to keep up with the current trends, but doesn't
            feel constrained to get the newest piece of tech as soon as it comes out.</p>
        <p><strong>Proficiency:</strong> Tom is quite adept at using technology at work and in his personal life.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>ATTITUDES AND NEEDS:</h3>
        <p><strong>Why are they using my site?:</strong> Tom would be using my site in response to an application I
            submitted for a job posting he put up, this would likely be his first contact point between the two of us.</p>
        <p><strong>What do they need?:</strong> Tom would potentially be in need of someone proficient enough with html,
            css, and javascript, to fill an intern roll for his company. Through my portfolio Tom should be able to get
            the understanding that I meet all requirements for this potential opening and maybe even stand above other
            applicants in one way or another.</p>
        <p><strong>Why my site?:</strong> Tom has many portfolio websites to sort through, because of this he prefers
            websites that quickly displays one's abilities in an easily consumable and appealing way. My website is easy
            to navigate and displays all necessary information someone looking to hire me would need to know, without
            overwhelming them with text but still providing them the necessary details in the event they would
            like to delve further.</p>
        <p><strong>Tom is a First-time Visitor to my website</strong></p>
        <br>

        <p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> Tom works for a small-medium sized software company, as such he receives
            hundreds of applications and portfolios to look through. Due to this he can spend a max of 1-2 minutes
            looking through each portfolio without compromising efficiency; he prefers portfolios that are quick and to
            the point. Tom has gone through almost 50 websites looking for the right applicant but has yet to find any
            that outshine the others, he has a week to gather the top five candidates.</p>
        <p><strong>Goals:</strong> Within the time period he's allotted for each portfolio, he would like to get a feel
            for the applicant and determine whether they are eligible to be one of the five selected for next steps.
            There are over 50 other candidates for this position, just "interesting" won't get you on the list.</p>
        <p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, Tom needs to quickly determine whether the portfolio he is viewing
            is a top candidate for the intern position.</p>
