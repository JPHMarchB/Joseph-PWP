<h1>PWP Milestone 2</h1>

<br>

<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
<p>My site will be three pages containing the following:</p>

<br>
<h2>Page 1</h2>
<h3>Opening view:</h3>
<p>An opening welcome page, an oneliner introducing what I do (front-end development) and a quick oneliner about my
    skills, in addition to a profession picture of my self.</p>

<br>

<h3>Intro:</h3>
<p>A small summary of my professional and technical skills something similar to a summary you'd see on a resume.
    For this section I plan to have a scroll reveal effect for the text, which will highlight the text as the viewer scrolls
    down the page.</p>

<br>

<h3>Projects:</h3>
<p>The next section will display projects I've taken part in, with a title of the project and a small description to
    help those reading understand the content. Here I would like to add a mouseover effect, potentially something that
    indicates you are hovering over a link to the deployment or GitHub for the project.</p>

<br>

<h3>Footer:</h3>
<p>This will be the final section you see on the home page it contains an image background and links to my socials, i.e.
    LinkedIn GitHub along with links to the other pages on the website, contact and about me.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 2</h2>
<h3>Contact Page:</h3>
<p>This page contains input fields which will allow people to quickly contact me with their name and message. It will
    also have alternative methods to contact me and my socials will be listed as well. P.S: Most of the outside items on
    the contact page and about page are styling outlines not actual page functions.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Page 3</h2>
<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>This section will detail some of my life story and how I've come into the situation I am in today, I felt I should
    exclude anything professional, except my coding languages, and make it more of a "My Story" section as I will
    be linking to my resume in the webpage and that covers all the professional side of things.</p>
